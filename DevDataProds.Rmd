## Manual Transmissions Appear To Achieve Better Mileage...

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(datasets)
mdl_am<-lm(mpg~am,data=mtcars) 
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
#visualize with a boxplot
boxplot(mpg~am,data=mtcars,notch=FALSE, 
        col=(c("red","light blue")),
        main="Boxplot: mpg x am", 
        xlab="Transmission",
        ylab="MPG")
#scatter plot with regression line
plot(as.numeric(as.character(mtcars$am)),mtcars$mpg,
        main="Model: mpg~am", 
        xlab="Transmission",
        ylab="MPG")
abline(mdl_am)
```

## ... Or DO They?!?

- Are other variables better predictors?
- Do these variables correlate highly with Transmission?

## You Have The Power

1. Use The mtcars Variable Correlation Analyzer
2. Use radio buttons to select the variable of interest
3. See how it correlates with mpg.  If it's high...
4. Does it correlate highly with transmission too?
